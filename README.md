# *G*it *U*RL *S*haring (GUS) vim plugin 

GUS adds commands to vim that print the git HTTP URL for the code under the cursor and copy the URL to the clipboard if possible. 

GUS is a simple tool that helps vim users share links to code for rapid collaborative analysis via IRC/Slack/chat, wikis, and so on.

Move your cursor to the line you want the URL for and run `:GUS`

Then share the URL:

## Installation

[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is the recommended way to install GUS.

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/jfoote/vim-GUS.git

Then reload vim and try one of the GUS commands.

## Commands

### :GUS

This command prints the URL for the current line number and copies it to the clipboard if possible.

### :GUM

This command prints a markdown-formatted link for the current line number's URL and copies it to the clipboard if possible.

### :GUR

This command prints a redmine-formatted link for the current line number's URL and copies it to the clipboard if possible.

### :GUW

This command prints the location of the single-file GUS plugin implementation ([gus.vim](http://github.com/jfoote/vim-GUS/blob/master/plugin/gus.vim)) on your local filesystem to encourage hacking on it.

## How it works

### URLs

Well-known git commands are used to determine the current git repo's remote and relative file path. A simple string substitution is used to replace any `ssh://` URL schemes with `http://`. 

The URL creation logic is located in a single function, `gus#link_url`, in the single file that implements this plugin, [gus.vim](http://github.com/jfoote/vim-GUS/blob/master/plugin/gus.vim). If this hack won't work for you feel free to edit the code to suit your needs. As mentioned above, you can use the `:GUW` command in vim to locate the plugin file on your local filesystem if you forgot where you put it.

### Copying to clipboard

GUS uses common command line utilities, such as `pbcopy` on OSX, to copy respective URL text to the clipboard. If no supported command is found, the text is printed to the vim status bar so you can copy it manually.

The clipboard logic is located in a single function, `gus#copy`, in the single file that implements this plugin, [gus.vim](http://github.com/jfoote/vim-GUS/blob/master/plugin/gus.vim). If this hack won't work for you feel free to edit the code to suit your needs. You can use the `:GUW` command in vim to locate the plugin file on your local filesystem if you forgot where you put it.

## TODO

- [x] Add support for `xsel` and `xclip`
- [ ] Add support for Windows
